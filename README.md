Application cookbook
====================

This cookbook is designed to be able to describe and deploy web
applications. It provides the basic infrastructure; other cookbooks
are required to support specific combinations of frameworks and
application servers. The following cookbooks are available at this
time:

* application\_java (Java and Tomcat)
* application\_nginx (nginx reverse proxy)
* application\_php (PHP with mod\_php\_apache2)
* application\_python (Django with Gunicorn)
* application\_ruby (Rails with Passenger or Unicorn)

Backward compatibility
----------------------

As of version 2.0.0 of this cookbook, the recipes using configuration
stored in the `apps` data bag are fully deprecated and removed.
Version 1.0.4 of this cookbook is the last release where these recipes
were available.

See [COOK-1820](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1820).

Requirements
============

Chef 0.10.0 or higher required (for Chef environment use).

The previous dependencies have been moved out to the
application-stack-specific cookbooks, and this cookbook has no
external dependencies.

Resources/Providers
===================

The `application` LWRP configures the basic properties of most
applications, regardless of the framework or application server they
use. These include:

* SCM information for the deployment, such as the repository URL and
  branch name;
* deployment destination, including the filesystem path to deploy to;
* any OS packages to install as dependencies;
* optional callback to control the deployment.

This LWRP uses the `deploy_revision` LWRP to perform the bulk of its
tasks, and many concepts and parameters map directly to it. Check the
documentation for `deploy_revision` for more information.

Configuration of framework-specific aspects of the application are
performed by invoking a sub-resource; see the appropriate cookbook for
more documentation.

# Actions

- `:deploy`: deploy an application, including any necessary
  configuration, restarting the associated service if necessary
- `:force_deploy`: same as `:deploy`, but it will send a `:force_deploy`
  action to the deploy resource, directing it to deploy the
  application even if the same revision is already deployed

# Attribute Parameters

- `name`: name attribute. The name of the application you are setting
  up. This will be used to derive the default value for other
  attribute
- `packages`: an Array or Hash of packages to be installed before
  starting the deployment
- `path`: target path of the deployment; it will be created if it does
  not exist
- `owner`: the user that shall own the target path
- `group`: the group that shall own the target path
- `strategy`: the underlying LWRP that will be used to perform the
  deployment. The default is `:deploy_revision`, and it should never
  be necessary to change it
- `scm_provider`: the provider class to use for the deployment. It
  defaults to `Chef::Provider::Git`, you can set it to
  `Chef::Provider::Subversion` to deploy from an SVN repository
- `repository`: the URL of the repository the application should be
  checked out from
- `revision`: an identifier pointing to the revision that should be
  checked out
- `deploy_key`: the private key to use to access the repository via SSH
- `rollback_on_error`: if true, exceptions during a deployment will be
  caught and a clean rollback to the previous version will be
  attempted; the exception will then be re-raised. Defaults to true;
  change it only if you know what you are doing
- `environment`: a Hash of environment variables to set while running
  migrations
- `purge_before_symlink`: an Array of paths (relative to the checkout)
  to remove before creating symlinks
- `create_dirs_before_symlink`: an Array of paths (relative to the
  checkout) pointing to directories to create before creating symlinks
- `symlinks`: a Hash of shared/dir/path => release/dir/path. It
  determines which files and dirs in the shared directory get
  symlinked to the current release directory
- `symlink_before_migrate`: similar to symlinks, except that they will
  be linked before any migration is run
- `migrate`: if `true` then migrations will be run; defaults to false
- `migration_command`: a command to run to migrate the application from
  the previous to the current state
- `restart_command`: a command to run when restarting the application
- `environment_name`: the name of a framework-specific "environment"
  (for example the Rails environment). By default it is the same as
  the Chef environment, unless it is `_default`, in which case it is
  set to `production`
- `enable_submodules`: whether to enable git submodules in the deploy,
  passed into the deploy resource.

# Callback Attributes

You can also set a few attributes on this LWRP that are interpreted as
callback to be called at specific points during a deployment. If you
pass a block, it will be evaluated within a new context. If you pass a
string, it will be interpreted as a path (relative to the release
directory) to a file; if it exists, it will be loaded and evaluated as
though it were a Chef recipe.

The following callback attributes are available:

- `before_deploy`: invoked immediately after initial setup and before
  the deployment proper is started. This callback will be invoked on
  every Chef run
- `before_migrate`
- `before_symlink`
- `before_restart`
- `after_restart`

# Sub-resources

Anything that is not a known attribute will be interpreted as the name
of a sub-resource; the resource will be looked up, and any nested
attribute will be passed to it. More than one sub-resource can be
added to an application; the order is significant, with the latter
sub-resources overriding any sub-resource that comes before.

Sub-resources can set their own values for some attributes; if they
do, they will be merged together with the attribute set on the main
resource. The attributes that support this behavior are the following:

- `environment`: environment variables from the application and from
  sub-resources will be merged together, with later resources
  overriding values set in the application or previous resources
- `migration_command`: commands from the application and from
  sub-resources will be concatenated together joined with '&&' and run
  as a single shell command. The migration will only succeed if all
  the commands succeed
- `restart_command`: commands from the application and from
  sub-resources will be evaluated in order
- `symlink_before_migrate`: will be concatenated as a single array
- `callbacks`: sub-resources callbacks will be invoked first, followed
  by the application callbacks

Usage
=====

To use the application cookbook we recommend creating a cookbook named
after the application, e.g. `my_app`. In `metadata.rb` you should
declare a dependency on this cookbook and any framework cookbook the
application may need. For example a Rails application may include:

    depends "application"
    depends "application_ruby"

The default recipe should describe your application using the
`application` LWRP; you may also include additional recipes, for
example to set up a database, queues, search engines and other
components of your application.

A recipe using this LWRP may look like this:

    application "my_app" do
      path "/deploy/to/dir"
      owner "app-user"
      group "app-group"

      repository "http://git.example.com/my-app.git"
      revision "production"

      # Apply the rails LWRP from application_ruby
      rails do
        # Rails-specific configuration. See the README in the
        # application_ruby cookbook for more information.
      end

      # Apply the passenger_apache2 LWRP, also from application_ruby
      passenger_apache2 do
        # Passenger-specific configuration.
      end
    end

You can of course use any code necessary to determine the value of
attributes:

    application "my_app" do
      repository "http://git.example.com/my-app.git"
      revision node.chef_environment == "production" ? "production" : "develop"
    end

Attributes from the application and from sub-resources are merged
together:

    application "my_app" do
      restart_command "kill -1 `cat /var/run/one.pid`"
      environment "LC_ALL" => "en", "FOO" => "bar"

      rails do
        restart_command "touch /tmp/something"
        environment "LC_ALL" => "en_US"
      end

      passenger_apache2 do
        environment "FOO" => "baz"
      end
    end

    # at the end, you will have:
    #
    # restart_command #=> kill -1 `cat /var/run/one.pid` && touch /tmp/something
    # environment #=> LC_ALL=en_US FOO=baz

Most databases have the concept of migrations (or you can just use
your own):

    application "my_app" do
      path "/deploy/to/dir"
      owner "app-user"
      group "app-group"

      repository "http://git.example.com/my-app.git"
      revision "production"

      php do
        migrate true
        migration_command "your-applications-migrate-command"
      end
    end

This will run `your-applications-migrate-command`, with the current
directory set to the directory of the current checkout.

To use the application cookbook, we recommend creating a role named
after the application, e.g. `my_app`. Create a Ruby DSL role in your
chef-repo, or create the role directly with knife.

    % knife role show my_app -Fj
    {
      "name": "my_app",
      "chef_type": "role",
      "json_class": "Chef::Role",
      "default_attributes": {
      },
      "description": "",
      "run_list": [
        "recipe[my_app]"
      ],
      "override_attributes": {
      }
    }
